## 🕵️ Fake News Detector 🕵️‍♀️

This project uses Machine Learning to detect fake news, based on a provided dataset.

## 📂  Project Structure

- `fake news detection.ipynb` 📓: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for fake news detection, likely using machine learning algorithms.
dataset/: 
Fake.csv: CSV file with examples of fake news.
True.csv: CSV file with examples of true news.

- `dataset/`: Folder containing the training and testing data for the model.
    - `Fake.csv`: CSV file with examples of fake news.
    - `True.csv`: CSV file with examples of true news.



## 🤖 Possible Next Steps:

- **Explore the Notebook :** Open the fake news detection.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to view the code, data, and detection results.
- **Analyze the Data:** Investigate the CSV files in the dataset folder to understand the data structure and the attributes used in news classification.

- **Experiment with the Model:**  Test the trained model with new data to check its performance and generalization capability.



##  🚀 Next Levels:
- **Graphical Interface:** Create a web interface to interact with the model more user-friendly, allowing users to input text and receive real-time fake news classification.
- **Detection API:** Develop a REST API so that other systems can use the fake news detection model.
## ⚠️ Notes:
- The quality of the model directly depends on the quality and quantity of the data in the dataset.
- Fake news detection is a complex problem, and this project serves as a starting point for future research and development.

I hope this brief description helps guide your exploration of this project! 😉
